# Week5 Assignment

Unfortunately I was not able to use the Zodiac API because it required monthly subscription payment. Instead I signed up for a 14-day free trial subscription, which allowed me to use only a limited number of APIs. So I changed my idea from mashing up Zodiac and Indian Astrology APIs to mashing up Gemstone Suggestion API and Google Maps API. The request data for the Gemstone API required the birth month, day, year, and time as well as the longitude and latitude, so I thought it would be fun to create a webpage where you can find the longitude and latitude of where you were born or where you are currently living using the Google Maps API, and combine that data of with your birthdate to find three gemstones associated with you. For now I hooked up only the Gemstone Suggestion API to my webpage. By inputing your birthdate, you can find your life stone, benefic stone and lucky stone.
