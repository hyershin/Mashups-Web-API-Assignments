# Week4 Assignment

For my midterm, I finalized my idea to mashup a Zodiac API and Horoscope API so that when people type in their birth dates, my website will help the user find their zodiac sign and give a horoscope reading associated with that zodiac sign. I designed a single webpage with basic HTML, CSS, and JS interaction. I am hoping to update them as I progress more with the project.
